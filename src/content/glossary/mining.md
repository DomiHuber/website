# Mining

Mining is the process of producing new blocks through Proof-of-Work. It secures the blockchain by requiring real-world computational effort, thereby preventing double spending. Mining also issues new bitcoin via the block subsidy and distributes transaction fees. Today, Bitcoin mining is highly professionalized, carried out by specialized companies operating industrial-scale facilities (aka mining farms) with purpose-built ASIC hardware, optimized energy sourcing, and sophisticated operational strategies.
