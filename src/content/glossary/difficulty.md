# Difficulty

The Block difficulty is a measure of how hard it is to find a valid block hash that meets the current difficulty target. A block is only valid if its hash lies below a certain threshhold, known as the difficulty target. The difficulty target is adjusted every 2016 blocks, which correspond to approximately 2 weeks, to maintain an average block time of 10 minutes.
