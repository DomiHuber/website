# Block Time

The block time is the average interval between successive blocks added to the Bitcoin blockchain. The protocol targets a block time of 10 minutes by adjusting the difficulty every 2016 blocks to match the prevailing hashrate. While the expected average is 10 minutes, actual block intervals vary due to the probabilistic nature of Proof-of-Work.
