# ASP – Ark Service Provider

An Ark Service Provider (ASP) is a specialized participant in the proposed Ark protocol, a second-layer Bitcoin scaling solution. ASPs coordinate off-chain transaction batching and provide liquidity while users maintain self-custody of their private keys. ASPs replace the need for trusted intermediaries by relying on Bitcoin transactions and cryptographic guarantees.
