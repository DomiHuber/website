# Mining Pool

A mining pool is a group of miners who combine their hashrate to reduce variance in rewards. The pool operator distributes block rewards proportionally to contributed work. This stands in contrast to solo mining, where an individual miner attempts to find blocks independently. Solo mining pools offer a hybrid approach: each miner submits work individually but uses shared infrastructure to reduce operational overhead while still receiving full rewards when a block is found.
