# Hash Function

A hash function is a one-way mathematical function that produces a fixed-size output from arbitrary input data. Its key properties are that different inputs produce different outputs, one cannot reproduce the input from the output, and that even tiny changes in the input completely changes the output. Bitcoin relies on SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 as its primary hash functions.
