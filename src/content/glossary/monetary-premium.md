# Monetary premium

A monetary premium is the portion of an asset’s market value that exceeds its utility or intrinsic use-value, reflecting its role as money. Gold historically carried a large monetary premium due to its function as a store of value. Bitcoin’s value is similarly understood as arising primarily from its monetary properties rather than from industrial use.
