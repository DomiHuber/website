# Block Hash

A block hash is the output of applying the SHA-256 hash function twice to the block header. It uniquely identifies a block and must lie below the current difficulty target for the block to be considered valid. Because of the preimage resistance of the hash function, the only way to find a valid block hash is through brute-force computation in the Proof-of-Work process. This ensures that the Bitcoin blockchain is secured by computational power.
