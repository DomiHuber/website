# Block Height

The block height is the sequential number of a block in the blockchain, starting with the genesis block at height 0. It serves as a reference point for blocks and is used to measure blockchain length. The consensus mechanism of Bitcoin ensures that the highest valid chain by accumulated work is accepted.
