# Ark

The Ark protocol is a proposed second-layer solution for Bitcoin designed to enable scalable off-chain payments. It uses intermediaries called Ark Service Providers to aggregate user transfers while ultimately settling on the base layer. This design seeks to combine scalability, privacy, and reduced liquidity requirements compared to the Lightning Network.
