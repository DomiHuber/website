# Proof of Work (POW)

Proof-of-Work is Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism requiring miners to find block hashes below the current difficulty target. This secures the blockchain with verifiable computational power, preventing alteration of the transaction history. Miners receive a reward in bitcoin, known as a block reward, for providing this computing power to the network.
