Yves combines over ten years of experience in both traditional banking and the crypto space. As a committed Bitcoin maximalist for more than six years, he has developed a deep expertise in Bitcoin Treasury Strategy—now the central pillar of his strategic work.

## Why is Bitcoin interesting?

Bitcoin is more than just money or a means of communication — it is a philosophy.

I believe it has the power to transform not only how we think about finance and information exchange, but also how we approach work, time, and the very structure of our daily lives. Bitcoin represents a fundamental shift, one that could usher in the next evolution of human society.
