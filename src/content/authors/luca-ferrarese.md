# Dr. Luca Ferrarese

My background is in science, but a strong desire to understand Bitcoin led me on an intense, self-directed journey into the history of money, finance and macroeconomics. This exploration into new disciplines inspired me to share my findings through articles, presentations and podcasts. Applying the analytical lens of a molecular biologist gives me a unique perspective on these complex topics and the systemic changes Bitcoin is introducing.

## Why is Bitcoin interesting?

Money is the foundation of society, if it breaks, society breaks. Bitcoin represents a new paradigm: globally accessible money, independent from the control of any state or institution. It holds the potential to revolutionize how individuals store value, transact freely and achieve financial sovereignty.
