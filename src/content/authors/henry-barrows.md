## Why is Bitcoin interesting?

Bitcoin is the first digitally native asset with absolute, programmatic scarcity. It introduced a monetary network that operates in cyberspace without reliance on any third party; open, global, and verifiable by anyone. In just over a decade, it has grown to a multi‑trillion‑dollar asset class. Beyond price, Bitcoin challenges fiat-era incentives—offering a transparent, rules-based alternative to discretionary monetary expansion. Bitcoin represents resilient infrastructure—and practical hope.

## Favorite Quote

Bitcoin isn't a company, a product, or a subscription. It's more than "money" in the narrow sense. Currency is simply the first widely recognized application of blockchain. The blockchain itself is a trust platform—a public, auditable system for transferring value without a single controlling entity. In this light, Bitcoin is monetary energy: decentralization applied to how humans communicate value.
