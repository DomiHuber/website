## Why is Bitcoin interesting?

Bitcoin represents a fundamental shift in how we think about money and power. Being permissionless is not just technically interesting; it's philosophically profound. Bitcoin is a living experiment in decentralized trust, and watching it unfold is both exciting and inspiring. The energy debate makes it even more interesting as it forces us to confront real questions about value, sustainability, and what we as a society are willing to spend resources on for future generations. It should be a strategic topic for anyone!
