Proof of Stake (POS);?;AI written;Proof of Stake is a consensus mechanism where block creation rights are assigned based on ownership of the native asset, rather than computational work. Unlike Proof-of-Work, PoS lacks an external cost anchor, making it vulnerable to different security trade-offs.;

51 percent attack;good to go;human written;A 51 percent attack occurs when a single entity controls more than half of the network’s total hash rate. This allows the attacker to create a competing blockchain that outpaces the honest chain, enabling double spending and transaction censorship. The attack does not permit creation of invalid coins or breaking of cryptography but undermines confidence in the immutability of the ledger. Today, a 51 percent attack is practically inconceivable given the immense computational power it would require to outpace Bitcoin's current hashrate.;
Atomic Swap;good to go;human written;An atomic swap is a protocol that enables two parties to exchange assets across different blockchains without a trusted intermediary. It relies on hash time-locked contracts (HTLCs), which ensure that the transaction is completed within the set timeframe. There are two types of atomic swaps: on-chain swaps between two different cryptocurrencies on two seperate blockchains, and off-chain swaps on second-layer channels off a main blockchain, such as the Lightning Network.;002
Bitcoin Core;good to go;human written;Bitcoin Core is the open-source reference software implementation of the Bitcoin protocol. It provides a full node that enforces consensus rules by validating transactions and blocks. Although it is widely used, Bitcoin Core is not the only implementation of the Bitcoin protocol.;
Block;good to go;human written;A block is a data structure in the Bitcoin blockchain containing a set of validated transactions, a reference to the previous block’s hash, and a nonce satisfying the current difficulty target. Blocks are produced by miners via Proof-of-Work and linked together to form the immutable ledger.;
Block Fee;good to go;human written;A block fee is the total sum of transaction fees payed in a block. Together with the block subsidy, it constitutes the block reward received by the miner. Fees are determined by the difference between input and output values in a transaction.;
Block Hash;good to go;human written;A block hash is the output of applying the SHA-256 hash function twice to the block header. It uniquely identifies a block and must lie below the current difficulty target for the block to be considered valid. Because of the preimage resistance of the hash function, the only way to find a valid block hash is through brute-force computation in the Proof-of-Work process. This ensures that the Bitcoin blockchain is secured by computational power.;
Block Header;good to go;human written;The block header is an 80-byte metadata structure summarizing a block. It contains the previous block’s hash, the Merkle root of included transactions, the timestamp, the difficulty target, and the nonce. Miners repeatedly modify the nonce when performing Proof-of-Work.;
Block Height;good to go;human written;The block height is the sequential number of a block in the blockchain, starting with the genesis block at height 0. It serves as a reference point for blocks and is used to measure blockchain length. The consensus mechanism of Bitcoin ensures that the highest valid chain by accumulated work is accepted.;
Block Reward;good to go;human written;The block reward is the incentive given to a miner for appending a valid block to the blockchain. It consists of the block subsidy and the collected block fees. Over time, the subsidy decreases via scheduled halvings, shifting reliance to transaction fees.;
Block Subsidy;good to go;human written;The block subsidy is the newly issued bitcoin in each block. It began at 50 bitcoin and is reduced by half every 210,000 blocks in the halving process. Eventually, the subsidy will reach zero, leaving only transaction fees as miner incentives.;
Block Time;good to go;human written;The block time is the average interval between successive blocks added to the Bitcoin blockchain. The protocol targets a block time of 10 minutes by adjusting the difficulty every 2016 blocks to match the prevailing hashrate. While the expected average is 10 minutes, actual block intervals vary due to the probabilistic nature of Proof-of-Work.;
Blockchain;good to go;human written;A blockchain is a sequential chain of  blocks, which are cryptographically linked by blocks hashes. It serves as a public, append-only ledger of all transactions. In Bitcoin, the blockchain is secured by Proof-of-Work, making historical records computationally infeasible to alter.;
Coinbase Transaction;good to go;human written;A coinbase transaction is the first transaction in each block, created by the successful miner. It has no inputs and pays the block reward to the miner. The coinbase field may also include arbitrary data such as extra nonces or text messages.;
Consensus Mechanism;good to go;human written;A consensus mechanism is a set of rules by which distributed systems agree on a single valid state of the ledger. In Bitcoin, consensus arises from block validation rules and the rule to accept the chain with the most accumulated Proof-of-Work.;
Debt-deflation dynamic;good to go;human written;The debt-deflation dynamic describes a self-reinforcing cycle in which falling prices increase the real burden of outstanding debt. As prices and nominal incomes decline, the fixed nominal value of debt and interest payments becomes harder to service. This strain leads to defaults and deleveraging, reducing aggregate demand and pushing prices down further. The resulting credit contraction and bankruptcies amplify the process, creating a deflationary spiral that can destabilize the entire financial system.;004
Difficulty;good to go;human written;The Block difficulty is a measure of how hard it is to find a valid block hash that meets the current difficulty target. A block is only valid if its hash lies below a certain threshhold, known as the difficulty target. The difficulty target is adjusted every 2016 blocks, which correspond to approximately 2 weeks, to maintain an average block time of 10 minutes.;
Full Node;good to go;human written;A full node is software that independently validates all transactions and blocks against consensus rules. Full nodes enforce the protocol and maintain the UTXO set. Running a full node is essential for verifying Bitcoin without trusting third parties.;
Genesis Block;good to go;human written;The genesis block is the first block in the Bitcoin blockchain, mined by Satoshi Nakamoto on January 3, 2009. It has a block height of 0 and contains a message referencing a newspaper headline about bank bailouts. Its structure is hardcoded in every Bitcoin client.;
Halving;good to go;human written;A halving is the scheduled reduction of the block subsidy by 50% every 210,000 blocks, which corresponds to approximately every four years. The halvings ensure the fixed supply of about 21 million bitcoin (20,999,999.9769 BTC to be exact) that will ever exist.;
Hash Function;good to go;human written;A hash function is a one-way mathematical function that produces a fixed-size output from arbitrary input data. Its key properties are that different inputs produce different outputs, one cannot reproduce the input from the output, and that even tiny changes in the input completely changes the output. Bitcoin relies on SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 as its primary hash functions.;
Hashrate;good to go;human written;The hashrate is the total computational power applied to Proof-of-Work in the Bitcoin network. It is measured in hashes per second and determines the overall security against attacks such as a 51 percent attack. Higher hashrate increases network resilience.;
Miner;good to go;human written;A miner is an entity operating specialized hardware to perform Proof-of-Work. Miners assemble valid transactions into blocks and attempt to find a nonce that produces a block hash below the current difficulty target. Successful miners receive the block reward.;
Mining;good to go;human written;Mining is the process of producing new blocks through Proof-of-Work. It secures the blockchain by requiring real-world computational effort, thereby preventing double spending. Mining also issues new bitcoin via the block subsidy and distributes transaction fees. Today, Bitcoin mining is highly professionalized, carried out by specialized companies operating industrial-scale facilities (aka mining farms) with purpose-built ASIC hardware, optimized energy sourcing, and sophisticated operational strategies.;
Mining Farm;good to go;human written;A mining farm is a large-scale facility dedicated to mining. It typically hosts thousands of ASICs in a location with low-cost electricity and effective cooling. Mining farms dominate the total network hashrate due to economies of scale.;
Mining Pool;good to go;human written;A mining pool is a group of miners who combine their hashrate to reduce variance in rewards. The pool operator distributes block rewards proportionally to contributed work. This stands in contrast to solo mining, where an individual miner attempts to find blocks independently. Solo mining pools offer a hybrid approach: each miner submits work individually but uses shared infrastructure to reduce operational overhead while still receiving full rewards when a block is found.;
Monetary premium;good to go;human written;A monetary premium is the portion of an asset’s market value that exceeds its utility or intrinsic use-value, reflecting its role as money. Gold historically carried a large monetary premium due to its function as a store of value. Bitcoin’s value is similarly understood as arising primarily from its monetary properties rather than from industrial use.;004
Node;good to go;human written;A node is software that participates in the Bitcoin network by following consensus rules, validating transactions and blocks, and relaying information. A full node independently verifies all rules, while a light node relies on external validation.;
Nonce;good to go;human written;A nonce is a 32-bit field in the block header that miners vary when performing Proof-of-Work. By changing the nonce, miners attempt to find a valid hash below the difficulty target. When nonce space is exhausted, other fields such as the coinbase extra nonce are adjusted.;
Petrodollar;good to go;human written;The petrodollar refers to the global system in which international oil sales are predominantly denominated and settled in U.S. dollars. This arrangement, established in the 1970s, reinforced the dollar’s status as the world’s primary reserve currency. The petrodollar system creates structural demand for dollars and U.S. debt, shaping international monetary and trade dynamics.;004
Proof of Work (POW);good to go;human written;Proof-of-Work is Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism requiring miners to find block hashes below the current difficulty target. This secures the blockchain with verifiable computational power, preventing alteration of the transaction history. Miners receive a reward in bitcoin, known as a block reward, for providing this computing power to the network.;002
RIPEMD-160;good to go;human written;RIPEMD-160 is a cryptographic hash function producing a 160-bit output. Bitcoin uses RIPEMD-160 applied to a SHA-256 hash of a public key to generate addresses. This process shortens keys and adds an extra layer of security.;
Satoshi Nakamoto;good to go;human written;Satoshi Nakamoto is the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. He published the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2008 and released the first version of the reference implementation, Bitcoin Core, in January 2009. Satoshi mined the genesis block and contributed to the early development of the protocol before disappearing in 2010. To this day, it remains unknown who Satoshi Nakamoto is—or whether the name represents a single individual or a group of people.;
SHA-256;good to go;human written;SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function producing a 256-bit output. It is the core algorithm in Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Workand address generation. Double SHA-256 is applied to block headers to secure the blockchain.;
Solo Mining;good to go;human written;Solo mining is the practice of an individual miner attempting to find valid blocks independently, rather than joining a mining pool. While feasible in Bitcoin’s early days, solo mining is now highly unlikely to succeed due to the vast network hashrate.;
UTXO – Unspent Transaction Output;good to go;human written;An unspent transaction output (UTXO) is a chunk of bitcoin that was received in a previous transaction but has not yet been spent. An UTXO can serve as an input of a new Bitcoin transaction. Only an owner of the private key corresponding to the bitcoin address, which controls the UTXO, can spend the UTXO in a new transaction. For that reason, the complete collection of all UTXOs at any given time, known as the UTXO set, fully represents the current global state of bitcoin ownership.;002
UTXO Management;good to go;human written;UTXO management refers to the strategy and handling of multiple unspent transaction outputs within a wallet. Efficient UTXO management reduces transaction fees, avoids unnecessary address reuse, and minimizes privacy leaks. It also ensures that inputs are selected in a way that balances performance, cost, and long-term usability of the UTXO set.;
UTXO Set;good to go;human written;The UTXO set is the complete collection of all currently spendable transaction outputs in the Bitcoin system. It represents the global state of bitcoin ownership and is maintained by all full nodes.;
Ark;good to go;human written;The Ark protocol is a proposed second-layer solution for Bitcoin designed to enable scalable off-chain payments. It uses intermediaries called Ark Service Providers to aggregate user transfers while ultimately settling on the base layer. This design seeks to combine scalability, privacy, and reduced liquidity requirements compared to the Lightning Network.;
ASP – Ark Service Provider;good to go;human written;An Ark Service Provider (ASP) is a specialized participant in the proposed Ark protocol, a second-layer Bitcoin scaling solution. ASPs coordinate off-chain transaction batching and provide liquidity while users maintain self-custody of their private keys. ASPs replace the need for trusted intermediaries by relying on Bitcoin transactions and cryptographic guarantees.;002
Financialization;good to go;human written;Financialization is the process by which financial markets, instruments, and motives gain increasing influence over economic activity. The term is sometimes used to describe the development of financial capitalism from 1980 to the present, a period during which debt-to-equity ratios increased and financial services grew to account for a larger share of national income relative to other sectors. It is characterized by the expansion of leverage, derivatives, and speculative capital allocation relative to productive investment. From a Bitcoin perspective, financialization can blur the boundary between sound monetary assets and financial claims built upon them.;004
Fiscal dominance;good to go;human written;Fiscal dominance describes a situation in which government debt levels and budgetary needs constrain central bank policy. Under fiscal dominance, monetary authorities must prioritize financing state deficits—typically through inflationary measures—over price stability. Bitcoin is sometimes framed as an escape from the risks inherent in prolonged fiscal dominance.;004
Adress;;AI written;A Bitcoin address is an identifier used to receive transactions. It is derived from a user’s public key through hashing and encoding, ensuring compactness and error detection. Common address formats include Base58Check (legacy), Bech32 (SegWit), and Bech32m (Taproot), each reflecting different script types.;
Altcoin;;AI written;An altcoin is any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin. Altcoins often modify parameters such as consensus mechanism, monetary policy, or scripting features. Some exist as independent blockchains, while others are tokens on external platforms such as Ethereum.;
AML – Anti-Money Laundering;;AI written;Anti-Money Laundering (AML) refers to the set of regulations and practices aimed at preventing the use of financial systems to disguise the origins of illicit funds. In the Bitcoin context, AML requirements are often imposed on custodial wallets, exchanges, and service providers, typically in combination with KYC obligations.;
Anarcho Capitalism;;AI written;Anarcho-capitalism is a political philosophy advocating for the elimination of the state in favor of voluntary exchange and private property rights. In the context of Bitcoin, it is associated with the idea that decentralized money enables economic systems independent of state control.;
ASIC – Application Specific Integrated Circuit;;AI written;An ASIC is a hardware circuit built for a single computational task. In mining, ASICs are optimized exclusively for SHA-256 hashing, making them vastly more efficient than CPUs, GPUs, or FPGAs. Their introduction professionalized mining and concentrated it in industrial-scale facilities.;
Austrian School of Economics;;AI written;The Austrian School of Economics is a school of thought emphasizing individual decision-making, sound money, and skepticism toward central planning. Its insights on monetary policy and inflation underpin much of the ideological support for Bitcoin as a form of digital hard money.;
Base Layer;;AI written;The base layer refers to the main Bitcoin blockchain, where transactions are settled and secured by Proof-of-Work. Higher-layer protocols such as the Lightning Network and Ark extend its functionality but rely on the base layer for final settlement and security guarantees.;
Batching;;AI written;Batching is the practice of combining multiple payment outputs into a single transaction. This reduces overall data size on the blockchain and lowers transaction fees. Exchanges and high-volume senders often use batching to improve efficiency and scalability.;
Bit Gold;;AI written;Bit gold was a digital currency design proposed by Nick Szabo in 1998. It outlined a system combining reusable Proof-of-Work and distributed timestamping to create scarce digital assets. Although never implemented, it directly influenced the creation of Bitcoin.;
Bitcoin;;AI written;Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency and peer-to-peer payment network secured by Proof-of-Work. It records transactions in a public blockchain, maintained by independently validating nodes. Bitcoin has a fixed monetary supply of 21 million coins, enforced by consensus rules. Its design eliminates the need for intermediaries, combining digital scarcity with censorship resistance and global accessibility.;
Bitcoin ATM;;AI written;A Bitcoin ATM is a physical kiosk that allows users to buy or sell Bitcoin using cash or electronic payments. Depending on the machine, users can deposit fiat currency to receive Bitcoin or sell Bitcoin for fiat withdrawal. These ATMs often charge higher fees than online exchanges but provide local accessibility.;
Bitcoin Cash;;AI written;Bitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency created in 2017 through a contentious hard fork of Bitcoin. It increased the maximum block size to allow higher on-chain throughput. While it shares Bitcoin’s origin and supply schedule, it operates under different consensus rules and a separate development community.;
Bitcoin Dominance;;AI written;Bitcoin dominance is the percentage of Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to that of all cryptocurrencies combined. It is often cited as a measure of Bitcoin’s strength or investor confidence compared to altcoins. Fluctuations in dominance reflect shifts in market perception and speculation.;
Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP);;AI written;A Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) is a formal document suggesting technical or informational changes to the Bitcoin protocol. BIPs define consensus changes, standardization efforts, or best practices. Examples include BIP32 (HD wallets), BIP39 (mnemonic phrases), and BIP141 (SegWit).;
Bitcoin Maximalism;;AI written;Bitcoin maximalism is the belief that Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that will maintain long-term relevance. Advocates argue that Bitcoin’s decentralization, security, and scarcity make other altcoins redundant or inferior. Maximalists reject diversification into other cryptocurrencies.;
Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (Bitcoin SV);;AI written;Bitcoin SV is a cryptocurrency that split from Bitcoin Cash in 2018 via a hard fork. It aims to implement what it claims is Satoshi Nakamoto’s “original vision” by enabling unbounded block sizes and on-chain scaling. Critics argue that such design compromises decentralization and security.;
Block Size;;AI written;Block size refers to the maximum data capacity of a block. In Bitcoin, blocks are measured in weight units, with a maximum size of 4 million weight units following the adoption of SegWit. Block size influences throughput and resource requirements for nodes.;
Blockchain Explorer;;AI written;A blockchain explorer is a tool for inspecting the contents of the blockchain. It allows users to search for blocks, transactions, and addresses, and to monitor confirmations and balances derived from the UTXO set. Explorers provide transparency but require trust in the operator.;
BTC;;AI written;BTC is the commonly used ticker symbol for bitcoin, the native currency of the Bitcoin network. One BTC is divisible into 100 million satoshis, the smallest unit recognized by the protocol. BTC is used both as a medium of exchange and as a store of value.;
CBDC - Central Bank Digital Currency;;AI written;A CBDC is a digital liability of a central bank, representing fiat money in electronic form. Unlike Bitcoin, CBDCs are permissioned and centrally controlled. They allow direct state oversight and potential programmability of money, contrasting with Bitcoin’s decentralized nature.;
Checksum;;AI written;A checksum is a short data string used to detect errors in transmission or storage. In Bitcoin, checksums are appended to addresses and wallet seeds to prevent mistyped or corrupted data. They are derived from cryptographic hash functions.;
Cloud Mining;;AI written;Cloud mining is the practice of renting hashrate from a remote data center to participate in mining. Users pay a fee to access external hardware rather than running devices themselves. It often exposes participants to counterparty risk and has been associated with scams.;
CoinJoin;;AI written;CoinJoin is a privacy technique that aggregates multiple users’ transactions into a single transaction. By mixing inputs and outputs, it obscures which coins belong to which participant. CoinJoin does not alter consensus rules and operates within standard Bitcoin scripting.;
Cold Wallet;;AI written;A cold wallet is a storage method where private keys are kept offline, disconnected from the internet. Examples include hardware wallets, paper wallets, and air-gapped devices. Cold wallets reduce exposure to online attacks and are suitable for long-term storage of significant amounts of bitcoin.;
Confirmation;;AI written;A confirmation indicates that a transaction has been included in a block and is part of the blockchain. Each subsequent block added on top of it increases its confirmation count. More confirmations reduce the risk of a double spend.;
Cryptocurrency;;AI written;A cryptocurrency is a digital asset that uses cryptography for issuance and transaction validation. Bitcoin is the first and most prominent cryptocurrency, using a decentralized blockchain secured by Proof-of-Work. Most other cryptocurrencies, often called altcoins, modify or extend Bitcoin’s design.;
Custodial Wallet;;AI written;A custodial wallet is a wallet in which a third party controls the user’s private keys. Exchanges and hosted wallet providers commonly offer custodial wallets. They provide convenience but reintroduce counterparty risk, violating the principle “not your keys, not your coins.”;
Cypherpunk;;AI written;A cypherpunk is a member of a movement advocating the use of strong cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies as tools for social and political change. Bitcoin emerged from the cypherpunk tradition, combining digital cash concepts with decentralized consensus.;
Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT);;AI written;Distributed ledger technology is a general term for systems that record data across multiple computers without a central authority. A blockchain is one form of DLT, distinguished by its sequential structure of blocks. Bitcoin is the first successful application of blockchain-based DLT.;
Doublespend / Doublespending Problem;;AI written;The double spending problem refers to the risk that a digital token could be spent more than once. Bitcoin solves this problem by recording transactions in a public blockchain secured by Proof-of-Work, making past entries computationally infeasible to reverse.;
ECDSA – Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm;;AI written;ECDSA is the asymmetric cryptographic scheme used in Bitcoin to prove ownership of private keys. It enables creation of digital signatures that can be verified with corresponding public keys. Bitcoin uses the secp256k1 elliptic curve for ECDSA.;
Encryption;;AI written;Encryption is the process of converting readable data into ciphertext using a cipher and a secret key. In Bitcoin, encryption is commonly used to secure wallet files and communication channels, while the consensus system itself relies primarily on hashing and digital signatures.;
Fiat Currency;;AI written;A fiat currency is money issued by a state and declared legal tender, without intrinsic value or backing by a commodity. Unlike Bitcoin, its supply is controlled by central banks and can be expanded arbitrarily. Examples include the US dollar, euro, and yen.;
Fork;;AI written;A fork occurs when the blockchain diverges into two possible histories. Temporary forks happen naturally when two blocks are mined simultaneously, but consensus resolves them. Permanent forks occur when rule changes cause an incompatible split, as in a hard fork.;
Gold Standard;;AI written;The gold standard is a monetary system in which currency is directly convertible into a fixed amount of gold. Bitcoin is often compared to gold due to its scarcity and resistance to debasement. Unlike fiat under the gold standard, Bitcoin’s supply rules are enforced by protocol, not governments.;
Hard Fork;;AI written;A hard fork is a consensus rule change that is not backward-compatible. Nodes that do not upgrade reject blocks produced under new rules, causing a chain split. Examples include the creation of Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV.;
Hard Money;;AI written;Hard money is money that resists supply expansion, often requiring significant cost to produce. Gold is historically considered hard money due to its scarcity. Bitcoin is regarded as the hardest money, since its issuance is strictly limited to 21 million coins by protocol.;
Hardware Wallet;;AI written;A hardware wallet is a dedicated device for storing private keys securely. It isolates signing operations from potentially compromised computers, reducing exposure to malware. Hardware wallets are commonly used for cold storage.;
HD-Wallet;;AI written;An HD-wallet (hierarchical deterministic wallet) is a type of wallet defined in BIP32. It allows derivation of a tree of keysfrom a single seed, enabling backup and recovery with one root phrase. This design simplifies key management and improves usability.;
HODL;;AI written;HODL is slang originating from a misspelling of “hold,” meaning to keep bitcoin long-term regardless of price volatility. It reflects the belief that Bitcoin’s value will rise over time due to scarcity and adoption. HODLing contrasts with active trading strategies.;
Hot Wallet;;AI written;A hot wallet is a wallet connected to the internet, enabling quick access to funds for spending. Examples include mobile apps, browser wallets, and exchange accounts. Hot wallets are convenient but less secure than cold wallets.;
Invoice;;AI written;An invoice is a payment request specifying the amount, recipient, and additional details of a transaction. In the Lightning Network, invoices are generated using the BOLT11 standard, encoding payment data including routing information.;
Keynesian Economics;;AI written;Keynesian economics is a school of thought advocating active government intervention in the economy, particularly through fiscal and monetary policy. It contrasts with the Austrian School of Economics, which emphasizes market self-regulation. Bitcoin challenges Keynesian principles by operating outside state monetary control.;
KYC – Know Your Customer;;AI written;KYC refers to regulatory procedures requiring financial institutions and exchanges to verify the identity of their clients. Common steps include collecting passports, addresses, and proof of funds. KYC undermines pseudonymity in Bitcoin and creates centralized databases that may be subject to leaks and surveillance.;
Libertarianism;;AI written;Libertarianism is a political philosophy emphasizing individual freedom, voluntary exchange, and limited government intervention. Many early Bitcoin adopters were motivated by libertarian ideals, viewing Bitcoin as a tool to separate money from state control.;
Light Node;;AI written;A light node is a Bitcoin node that does not store the full blockchain but instead relies on Simplified Payment Verification (SPV). It downloads block headers and verifies transactions via Merkle proofs. Light nodes reduce resource requirements but depend on full nodes for validation.;
Lightning Network;;AI written;The Lightning Network is a second-layer payment protocol built on top of Bitcoin. It enables near-instant, low-cost off-chain transactions by using bidirectional payment channels. Security is ensured by the ability to settle disputes on the Bitcoin mainnet.;
Lightning Node;;AI written;A Lightning node is software that participates in the Lightning Network. It opens and maintains payment channels, routes payments across the network, and enforces channel balances using HTLCs (hashed time-locked contracts). Lightning nodes require periodic interaction with the Bitcoin blockchain for settlement.;
Mainnet;;AI written;Mainnet refers to the operational Bitcoin network where real BTC transactions take place. It is distinguished from testnet, which is a parallel environment for experimentation without economic value. Protocol changes and software upgrades are deployed cautiously on mainnet to avoid disruption.;
Master Key;;AI written;A master key is the root key in an HD-wallet. From it, a hierarchy of child keys can be deterministically derived using BIP32. Backup of the master key or its associated mnemonic phrase is sufficient to restore the entire wallet structure.;
Mempool;;AI written;The mempool (memory pool) is the collection of unconfirmed transactions stored by nodes awaiting inclusion in a block. Each node maintains its own mempool, which may differ slightly. Transaction fees influence the likelihood of a transaction being prioritized by miners.;
Merkle Tree;;AI written;A Merkle tree is a binary tree of hashes used to efficiently summarize all transactions in a block. Each transaction is hashed, then pairs of hashes are combined recursively until a single Merkle root remains. This structure allows compact SPV proofs.;
Mixer;;AI written;A mixer (or tumbler) is a service that obfuscates the transaction history of bitcoin by pooling and redistributing funds. Unlike CoinJoin, centralized mixers introduce custodial risk and have been subject to regulatory scrutiny and shutdowns.;
Mnemonic;;AI written;A mnemonic is a sequence of words encoding the seed of an HD-wallet, defined in BIP39. It enables human-readable backup and recovery of wallet keys. Mnemonics often include an additional checksum and may be combined with a passphrase for extra security.;
Mt. Gox;;AI written;Mt. Gox was a Bitcoin exchange based in Japan that operated from 2010 until its collapse in 2014. It lost approximately 850,000 BTC due to mismanagement and theft. The event remains one of the largest exchange failures in Bitcoin’s history.;
Multisignature;;AI written;A multisignature (multisig) setup requires multiple private keys to authorize a transaction. Common configurations include m-of-n schemes, such as 2-of-3. Multisig enhances security, supports shared custody, and underlies protocols such as Lightning Network channel funding.;
Nakamoto (unit);;AI written;A Nakamoto is sometimes proposed as a denomination equal to 1 million bitcoin. While not a standard unit in the protocol, it reflects homage to Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin.;
NGU – Number Go Up;;AI written;NGU is a meme shorthand for the expectation that the price of bitcoin will continually increase over time. It references Bitcoin’s programmed scarcity and the long-term adoption trend, contrasting with inflationary fiat currency.;
Nocoiner;;AI written;A nocoiner is slang for someone who does not own bitcoin, often dismissing or criticizing it. The term is used informally in online discourse to describe skeptics or late adopters.;
Non Custodial Wallet;;AI written;A non-custodial wallet is a wallet where the user retains sole control over the private keys. Unlike a custodial wallet, it does not depend on a third party to secure funds. Non-custodial wallets embody the principle of self-sovereignty in Bitcoin.;
Off-Chain;;AI written;Off-chain refers to actions or transactions that occur outside the blockchain. Examples include bilateral agreements, Lightning Network transactions, and custodial transfers. Off-chain methods can provide scalability and privacy benefits but rely on additional trust or enforcement mechanisms.;
On-Chain;;AI written;On-chain refers to actions recorded directly in the Bitcoin blockchain. On-chain transactions consume block space, incur fees, and gain security from Proof-of-Work and confirmations. On-chain settlement serves as the ultimate arbiter of disputes in second-layer protocols.;
OP_RETURN;;AI written;OP_RETURN is a Bitcoin script opcode allowing arbitrary data to be embedded in a transaction. Outputs with OP_RETURN are provably unspendable and excluded from the UTXO set. Use cases include digital notarization and metadata storage.;
Open Source;;AI written;Open source refers to software whose source code is publicly available for use, modification, and distribution. Bitcoin Core, the reference client, is open source, enabling transparency and peer review. Open-source development fosters resilience and decentralization.;
Oracle;;AI written;An oracle is an external data source that provides real-world information to a blockchain-based system. Oracles are often discussed in the context of smart contracts. Bitcoin itself minimizes reliance on oracles, but second-layer protocols may require them.;
Oracle Problem;;AI written;The oracle problem refers to the challenge of importing trustworthy external data into a trust-minimized system. Oracles introduce points of centralization and attack, undermining the security model of decentralized systems.;
Orphan Block;;AI written;An orphan block is a valid block not included in the best blockchain due to a competing block being accepted first. Orphans result from temporary forks and are eventually discarded, although the transactions within may still be confirmed in later blocks.;
P2P (Peer-to-Peer);;AI written;Peer-to-peer describes the network architecture in which nodes directly connect and share data without central intermediaries. Bitcoin’s P2P network propagates transactions and blocks, ensuring censorship resistance and decentralization.;
Paperwallet;;AI written;A paper wallet is a form of cold storage where private keys or mnemonics are printed on paper. While secure against online attacks, paper wallets risk physical damage or loss and are less practical than hardware wallets.;
Passphrase;;AI written;A passphrase is an additional secret that can be combined with a mnemonic in BIP39 wallets. It extends the derived key space, offering extra security against mnemonic compromise. Without the passphrase, wallet recovery is impossible.;
Payment Channel;;AI written;A payment channel is a mechanism enabling two parties to transact off-chain while using the blockchain only for opening and closing the channel. They are the fundamental building blocks of the Lightning Network.;
Precoiner;;AI written;A precoiner is slang for someone who does not yet own bitcoin but is not necessarily hostile toward it. The term is often used optimistically to describe potential future adopters.;
Private Key;;AI written;A private key is a randomly generated 256-bit number that grants control over a corresponding public key and its associated UTXOs. In Bitcoin, private keys are used to generate digital signatures that authorize transactions. Secure storage of private keys is critical, as loss or compromise results in irreversible loss of funds.;
Protocol;;AI written;A protocol is the set of formal rules governing communication and behavior in a network. In Bitcoin, the protocol defines transaction formats, block validation, and consensus rules. Changes to the protocol require broad agreement among nodesto avoid a fork.;
Public Key;;AI written;A public key is the cryptographic counterpart to a private key in public key cryptography. In Bitcoin, it is derived from the private key using the elliptic curve secp256k1. Public keys are used to generate Bitcoin addresses (via hash functions like SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160) and to verify digital signatures in transactions.;
Public Key Cryptography;;AI written;Public key cryptography is a cryptographic system using key pairs consisting of a private key and a public key. In Bitcoin, it enables digital signatures where the private key authorizes a transaction and the public key (or its hash) allows others to verify authenticity without revealing the secret.;
Ring Signature;;AI written;A ring signature is a digital signature scheme where a message is signed by one member of a group, but the verifier cannot determine which member produced it. While not part of Bitcoin, ring signatures are used in privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero to obscure transaction origins.;
Satoshi (unit);;AI written;A satoshi is the smallest indivisible unit of Bitcoin, equal to 0.00000001 BTC. All balances and transactions on the protocol level are denominated in satoshis. The term honors Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.;
Second Layer;;AI written;A second layer is a protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain to enhance scalability or functionality. Examples include the Lightning Network and sidechains. These systems rely on Bitcoin’s on-chain settlement for security guarantees.;
Seed  Phrase;;AI written;A seed phrase (or mnemonic) is a human-readable sequence of words representing the seed of an HD-wallet, typically generated according to BIP39. It allows deterministic derivation of all associated private keys. Loss of the seed phrase results in loss of funds.;
Segwit;;AI written;Segregated Witness (Segwit) is a Bitcoin protocol upgrade activated in 2017 via a soft fork. It separates transaction signatures (witness data) from the main transaction structure, reducing malleability and enabling capacity increases measured in virtual bytes (vBytes). Segwit also laid the foundation for Taproot.;
Settlement;;AI written;Settlement refers to the final and irreversible recording of a transaction in the Bitcoin blockchain. Once confirmed by sufficient blocks, the transaction cannot be reversed without reorganizing the chain, providing strong finality compared to traditional financial systems.;
Shitcoin;;AI written;Shitcoin is a derogatory term for cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin, implying they lack sound monetary properties or meaningful utility. From a Bitcoin maximalist perspective, all altcoins fall under this category due to inferior security or centralization.;
Sidechain;;AI written;A sidechain is a blockchain interoperable with Bitcoin via a two-way peg. It allows assets to be transferred between chains while experimenting with new features. Sidechains rely on their own consensus mechanism, making their security distinct from Bitcoin’s.;
Signature;;AI written;A signature is the cryptographic proof generated with a private key to authorize a Bitcoin transaction. Bitcoin signatures use the ECDSA scheme (and Schnorr since Taproot). They enable verification that the spender controls the relevant keys without revealing them.;
Simplified Payment Verification (SPV);;AI written;SPV is a method allowing light nodes to verify transactions without downloading the full blockchain. By checking block headers and Merkle proofs, an SPV client can confirm that a transaction is included in a valid block, though it trusts that the majority of work follows consensus.;
Smart Contract;;AI written;A smart contract is a programmable agreement enforced by code. In Bitcoin, smart contracts are implemented via the scripting system using primitives like multisig, timelocks, and OP_RETURN. Unlike Ethereum, Bitcoin contracts are deliberately limited to enhance security and robustness.;
Soft Fork;;AI written;A soft fork is a backward-compatible protocol change in Bitcoin. Nodes that do not upgrade still recognize blocks as valid, though upgraded nodes enforce additional rules. Segwit and Taproot were both activated via soft forks.;
Soft Money;;AI written;Soft money refers to currencies that can be easily inflated or devalued by monetary authorities. It contrasts with hard money, which has strong scarcity properties. Bitcoin is often described as hard money due to its fixed supply cap of 21 million coins.;
Sound Money;;AI written;Sound money is money with a stable value rooted in scarcity, durability, and resistance to manipulation. Historically associated with the gold standard, the concept applies to Bitcoin because of its algorithmically enforced fixed supply.;
Stable Coin;;AI written;A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency designed to maintain price stability, typically by pegging to a fiat currency like the US dollar. Unlike Bitcoin, stablecoins depend on centralized issuers or collateral mechanisms, introducing counterparty and regulatory risks.;
Stacking Sats;;AI written;Stacking sats refers to the practice of regularly accumulating satoshis, often through dollar-cost averaging. It emphasizes long-term holding of Bitcoin regardless of short-term price volatility.;
Taproot;;AI written;Taproot is a Bitcoin protocol upgrade activated in 2021 via a soft fork. It introduces Schnorr signatures and Merklized Abstract Syntax Trees (MAST), improving privacy, efficiency, and the expressiveness of Bitcoin’s scripting capabilities.;
Testnet;;AI written;Testnet is a parallel Bitcoin network used for development and experimentation. It uses valueless coins and has different consensus parameters from mainnet, allowing developers to test applications without economic risk.;
Timestamp;;AI written;A timestamp in Bitcoin records the approximate time of block creation. Each block header contains a timestamp field, which miners set within certain bounds. Timestamps anchor the blockchain to real-world chronology and contribute to the difficulty adjustment algorithm.;
Transaction Confirmation;;AI written;A transaction confirmation occurs when a transaction is included in a valid block. Each additional block added on top increases the confirmation count, reducing the probability of a successful reorganization. Six confirmations are traditionally considered sufficient for high-value settlement.;
Transaction Fee;;AI written;A transaction fee is the difference between the sum of inputs and outputs in a Bitcoin transaction. Fees incentivize minersto include transactions in blocks and form the long-term security budget once the block subsidy diminishes.;
Unit of Exchange;;AI written;Unit of exchange refers to the monetary function of facilitating trade by acting as an intermediary in transactions. Bitcoin fulfills this role both on-chain and in the Lightning Network, though adoption as a widespread exchange medium is still developing.;
Virtual Byte (vByte);;AI written;A virtual byte (vByte) is a unit of measurement for transaction size under Segwit. It accounts for both witness and non-witness data with appropriate weight, aligning transaction fees with block space usage;
Wallet;;AI written;A wallet is software or hardware managing private keys and facilitating Bitcoin transactions. Wallets can be custodial or non-custodial, and may take forms such as hardware wallets, mobile wallets, or paper wallets.;
Whale;;AI written;A whale is an entity that holds a very large amount of bitcoin. Whale movements can influence market liquidity and price, though Bitcoin’s decentralized market structure limits their long-term impact.;
Whitepaper;;AI written;The Bitcoin whitepaper, published by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, introduced Bitcoin as a “peer-to-peer electronic cash system.” It describes the design of Proof-of-Work, the blockchain, and the incentive structure that secures the system.;
XBT;;AI written;XBT is an alternative ticker symbol for Bitcoin, based on the ISO 4217 currency code standard. While BTC is more common, XBT is used in some financial contexts to align with formal currency naming conventions.;
Xpub – Extended Public Key;;AI written;An extended public key (xpub) is a component of HD-wallets, defined in BIP32. It allows derivation of all child public keys without access to the private key. Xpubs are often used for generating receive addresses in merchant applications.;
Zero Confirmation;;AI written;A zero-confirmation transaction is one that has been broadcast to the network but not yet included in a block. While visible in the mempool, it remains vulnerable to double spending until confirmed.;
Zero Knowledge Proof;;AI written;A zero-knowledge proof is a cryptographic technique allowing one party to prove knowledge of a statement without revealing the statement itself. While not part of Bitcoin’s base protocol, zero-knowledge proofs are explored in other cryptocurrencies for privacy enhancements.;
